## match_up_data_raw.csv

Data scraped from the individual bracket pages from topdeck.gg. Still messy. Errors include but are not limited to:
- pods with missing players
- pods with missing commander
- pods where all 4 players lost
- pods with a mix of draw, loss and/or win
- real 3 player pods that can't be distinguished from pods with missing players
- turn oder is very unreliable. Big topdeck events are probably fine, but for all  other events I can't guarantee that the turn order shown in the bracket page was followed
- pods are in no particular order
